## Growing an Inner Source Program

45 min

## Audience

This presentation will be given at [the 2018 ISC Fall Summit](http://paypal.github.io/InnerSourceCommons/events/isc-fall-2018-agenda/).
It is intended for those that are evangelizing inner source internally for their specific company.

## Abstract

"Inner source is a great idea! Go do inner source!"
You're the dedicated champion for inner source in your company.
What do you do now?
How do you realistically affect the behavior of dozens or hundreds of teams to the point where robust and pervasive inner sourcing is a normal part of the way that engineering is done?

This presentation shares principles, practical anecdotes, and relatable examples on this situation gleaned from experience at Nike.
While not claiming all of the answers, it summarizes the learnings of over a year of work in the area.

## Outline

#### Introduction

* Participation in inner source requires real amounts of care and feeding to be effective.
* Inner source is a culture change.
* You need an intentional strategy to change culture.

#### Culture Change Principles

* Lasting culture change grows imperceptibly and gradually rather than one mighty crack.
* Patterns for enterprise-wide change initiatives exist in More Fearless Change.
* The Opt In pattern.
* The Grass Roots pattern.

#### Components of an Inner Source Program

* A strategy of documentation, tooling, and training work together to change culture.
* Documentation should be aligned with _InnerSourcePatterns_.
* Categories of tooling: Discovery, Communication, Data.
* Inner source your inner source infrastructure.

#### The Collaboration Maturity Model

* Introduce each dimension individually: Space/Time, Artifact, Content.
* Growth in an individual or team happens as they uplevel from their current position on any dimension.
* Growth in the inner source program occurs as the normal position of collaboration on any dimension uplevels.

#### Conclusion

* Inner source is a culture change initiative.
* Barriers of difficulty prevent upleveling on the collaboration maturity model.
* Your inner source program provides tooling, documentation, and training to remove or reduce those barriers so that people opt in to a higher level of collaboration (on any dimension).
* Let's work on this together via the ISC and open source projects.

## Takeaways

After attending this presentation, we hope that viewers will:

* Gain ideas on how to roll out an inner source program.
* Understand the suggested purposes and principles of an inner source program.
* Understand the suggested component parts of an inner source program and their principles.
* Be excited to work together on their inner source program via the ISC.
